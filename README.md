# PyShipwrecking
## About
This is my first Python project.
It is a command line game written in **Python 3**.
As the name implies, you will have to wreck ships!

I warmly welcome any feedback!

## Acknowledgement 
This game was originally inspired by a similar game that is part of [Codecademy's](http://www.codecademy.com/) syllabus for their Python course.
